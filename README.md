Very basic CLI using STM32L073 Nucleo-64 board (NUCLEO-L073RZ)

Using the default setting of the board, with UART2 connected through the ST-LINK Virtual COM port.

Open a terminal, only one supported command so far:

go
-Toggles the LED and prints a message

Thrown together, will be tidied up and more functionality added
